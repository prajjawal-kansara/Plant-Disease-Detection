<h1>  Plant-Disease-Prediction-CNN-Deep-Leanring-Project- </h1>


<h2> Overview: </h2>
This project uses machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect plant diseases. 
The goal is to develop a system that can accurately identify diseases in plant leaves, enabling
early detection and prevention measures to be taken by farmers.

<h2> Features: </h2>

- Detection of various plant diseases, such as blight, rust, powdery mildew, etc.

- Real-time or batch processing of images for disease detection.
  
- User-friendly interface for interacting with the detection system.
  
- Integration with existing agricultural systems for automated monitoring and decision-making.

<h2> Installation: </h2>
<h3> Prerequisites  </h3>

- Python 

- TensorFlow

- Numpy

- Streamlit

- Required Python packages (specified in requirements.txt)
